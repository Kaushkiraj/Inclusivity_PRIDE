		<p>Welcome to Inclusivity - Pride! We provide information about each sexuality under the <strong>LGBTQIA+</strong> spectrum. Scroll through this website and visit each link to understand the respective sexuality and meaning associated with the pride flags. Enjoy the information that this website has to offer.</p>

			The terms and definitions mentioned in the website are always evolving and changing often mean different things to different people. They are provided here as a starting point for understanding.<br><br>
			One aspect that makes all the letters in LGBTQIA+ difficult for some people to understand is the difference between sex and gender. While sex and gender are terms that are often used interchangeably by people, they really do mean different things. Sex is all about the chromosomes, organs, and external genitalia, in simple words, its all about person's anatomy. Gender is a totally separate spectrum from sex; its more about how a person feels they best align with sociobehavioral norms or rules for each gender type.
