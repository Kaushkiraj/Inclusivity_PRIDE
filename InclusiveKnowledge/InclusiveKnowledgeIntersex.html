		<h1>Intersex</h1>
		<div>Intersex is a variation in sex charcteristics including chromosomes, gonads, or genitals that do not allow an individual to be distinctly identified as male or female. There are at least 16 different ways to be intersex. Some intersex people have XXY chromosomes, some have ambiguous genitalia or internal sex organs or hormones released during puberty which don't match their genitalia. Being intersex is a naturally occurring variation in humans; it is not pathological. Being intersex is not linked to sexual orientation or gender identity; intersex people can have different sexual orientations and gender identities and expressions. However, intersex people are not the same as transgender, which is why the "T" and the "I" are both included in LGBTQIA+. Intersex people have biological parts of both sexes. In transgender people, their sex and gender do not align. Hermaphrodite ia an outdated and inaccurate term that has been used to describe intersex people in the past. </div>

		<div>The flag was created by Morgan Carpenter in 2013. He quoted about the flag, "I wanted to create an image that people could use to represent intersex people without depending upon what I think are often misconceptions or stereotypes."</div>
		<ul class="links">
			<li><b>Yellow :</b> Inspired by a story told by fellow intersex individual Mani Mitchell to reclaim the slur "hermaphrodite" used against the intersex community</li>
			<li><b>Purple :</b> The circle is about being unbroken, about being whole and complete.</li>
